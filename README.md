## What i've done

generated password criteria verification with a selection of prompts. First the user must choose the length of password between a set minimum and limit. If the user doesn't select a valid length, the user is prompted to try again. If the user selects a valid length, the user is then prompted to select from the following criteria to make up their password.

- Does the user want symbol characters?
- Does the user want numbers?
- Does the user want uppercase characters?
- Does the user want lowercase characters?

If the user doesn't select an option, an invalid selection prompt is shown.

Once the user has selected a valid length with valid criteria, a password is generated in the box.
